Error: Checkoutセッション作成エラー: Not a valid URL
This means the fetch call to Stripe API is failing because the URL is not valid.
The STRIPE_SECRET_KEY env var might be empty on Vercel, causing the fetch URL to be malformed.
Or the PLAN_PRICE_MAP is returning empty strings because env vars are not loaded at module level.

PLAN_PRICE_MAP is defined at module level using process.env - this should work in Next.js API routes.
But the issue might be that the env vars are not available when the module is first loaded.

Need to make PLAN_PRICE_MAP lazy as well.
