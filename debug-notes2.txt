Debug API result:
stripeKeySet: true
stripeKeyPrefix: "sk_live_51..."
priceStarter: "price_1Sy1NhBSKx67dvmHCm1sEQUJ\n"  <-- NOTE THE \n!
pricePremium: "price_1Sy1NjBSKx67dvmH3AWtwgmQ\n"  <-- NOTE THE \n!
priceMax: "price_1Sy1NlBSKx67dvmHNUQdZVA6\n"  <-- NOTE THE \n!
appUrl: "https://tategatashort-analytics.com\n"  <-- NOTE THE \n!

PROBLEM: All environment variables have trailing newline characters (\n).
This is causing "Not a valid URL" error because the URL includes a newline.
The Stripe SDK connection error was also likely caused by the API key having a trailing newline.

SOLUTION: Trim all environment variables when reading them.
